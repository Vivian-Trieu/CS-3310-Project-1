## Assignment Details
Program in Java or C++ the following algorithms that we covered in the class:
1. Classical matrix multiplication
2. Naive divide-and-conquer matrix multiplication
3. Strassen’s matrix multiplication
Let the matrix size be n ×n. You can assume n is a power of 2.

Carry out a complete test of your algorithms
with random matrices of size n = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, ... (up to the largest size of n that your computer
can handle). In order to obtain more accurate results, each algorithm should be tested many times with
different matrices of the same size. The total time spent is then divided by the number of times the algorithm
is performed to obtain the time taken to solve instances of size n.
Write a detailed report together with graphs explaining the data sets, test strategies and explanation of the
results. Include the answer for the following questions: What are the theoretical complexity comparisons
of the three algorithms ? Is one algorithm always faster than the others ? Conclude your report with the
strength and constraints of your work.
